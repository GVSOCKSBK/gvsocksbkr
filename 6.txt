Q6. Write R script to:
a) Do two simulations of a binomial number with n = 100 and p = .5. Do you get the same 
results each time? What is different? What is similar?

b) Do a simulation of the normal two times. Once with n = 10, µ = 10 and σ = 10, the other 
with n = 10, µ = 100 and σ = 100. How are they different? How are they similar? Are 
both approximately normal?
