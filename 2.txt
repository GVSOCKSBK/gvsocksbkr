Q2. Using the Algae data set from package DMwR to complete the following tasks. 
a) create a graph that you find adequate to show the distribution of the values of algae a6.
b) show the distribution of the values of size 3.
c) check visually if oPO4 follows a normal distribution.
d) produce a graph that allows you to understand how the values of NO3 are distributed 
across the sizes of river.
e) using a graph check if the distribution of algae a1 varies with the speed of the river.
f) visualize the relationship between the frequencies of algae a1 and a6. Give the 
appropriate graph title, x-axis and y-axis title


str(airquality)

sum(complete.cases(airquality))
subset(airquality, Temp >= 70 & Temp <= 80)

summary(airquality$Wind)
airquality[order(-airquality$Temp),]
