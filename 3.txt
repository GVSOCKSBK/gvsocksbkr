Q3. Read the file Coweeta.CSV and write an R script to do the following:
a) count the number of observations per species. 
b) take a subset of the data including only those species with at least 10 observations. 
c) make a scatter plot of biomass versus height, with the symbol colour varying by species, 
and use filled squares for the symbols. Also add a title to the plot, in italics. 
d) log-transform biomass, and redraw the plot.


toy_data <- read.csv("toy_dataset.csv")

sum(City == "New York City")
head(toy_data[order(-Income), ], n = 5)
sum(Income > mean(Income))
max(Income[Gender=="Female"])
toy_data[sample(nrow(toy_data), 10), ]
